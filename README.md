Summary:
Launched to uncover business opportunities in the competitive food delivery landscape, this project analyzes restaurant and menu-level data from platforms like Zomato and Swiggy across Indian cities. The analysis spans across categories such as cuisine availability, price-to-rating performance, veg vs. non-veg distribution, item popularity, city-wise restaurant counts, and customer value insights. Using this data, the project aims to identify underserved cuisines in key markets, high-performing local vendors for potential partnerships, and pricing inefficiencies impacting customer satisfaction.

The goal is to enable smarter strategic decisions for regional expansion, promotional targeting, and menu optimization.
